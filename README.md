Spam Detection using Logistic Regression
* This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of labeled emails.

Dataset
* The dataset used in this project (mail_data.csv) contains two columns: Message (email content) and Category (spam or ham).â€¨
Usage
* Ensure you have Python installed.
* Run the spam_mail_detector.py script:bash
* The script will train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset, evaluate its performance, and predict the category of input email messages.
File Structure
* mail_data.csv: Dataset containing email messages and their categories.
* spam_mail_detector.py: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Dependencies
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
